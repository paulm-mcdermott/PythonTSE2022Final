# Coffee Shop Simulations
## Paul McDermott & Justin Standish-White

This project explores the coffeebar dataset and, using insights from analysing that dataset, develops a simulation programme in python. The end objective is to simulate 5 years of transactions for the coffee shop.


## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.
This project is the key deliverable for a master's level introduction to programming in Python at the Toulouse School of Economics. Our work herein uses a vast array of skills picked up during the short course. These include working with pandas, class structures, project management and general data analysis. 

This project is divided into four parts. They are summarised below.
1. Exploring existing data. We explore the provided coffeebar data and answer several questions as requested. The key information here is to determine what food and drinks the store sells and the relative popularity of these items amongst customers. Our results show clear time patterns in purchases, with patterns being homogenous within 3 distinct time periods: a morning slot from 8-11am, a lunch time slot from 11-1pm and an afternoon slot from 1-6pm. We can take the probabilities of buying each item within these slots and use these in our subsequent simulations.
2. Setting up a class structure. We have four types of customers that may enter the store. Returning customers have two types: regulars and hipsters, who differ in their initial budgets. Then, walk-ins are split into normal walk-ins and trip advisor tourists, the latter of which may leave a tip after their purchase. In this stage of the project, we set up these classes as well as
